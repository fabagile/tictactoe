# Getting Started with TicTacToe ML

## Introduction

This is a react version of the famous ***TicTacToe*** game, available in french and english (french by default); you may select your favorite language by switching the flag on the top of the app.

If you know the game, you may skip next chapter.

### How to play

The goal to achieve is to align the same symbol thrice vertically, horizontally or obliquely.

You can play on your own or with a friend.

Choose the symbol you want to play with: *X* or *O*; the game starts with *X*.

Then fill the grid, using your character; this one changes on each move, consequently turn and player. You can't replace, neither remove, a full cell.

There are nine empty cells at the game start. If all are full and that no line has been completed, the game is over.

### Display and layout.

You can see that the board is divided in two sections: the grid and a message box. Each time a cell is filled, the message changes. You may touch this box to restart after each game, never if the current one is still in progress.

### Languages

Actually, **french** and **english** are the only available languages. Some will come later (tell me in my [mailbox](mailto:fabagile@outlook.fr) if you want me to add yours.)

**And now, enjoy** ðŸ˜€

## Project info

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
